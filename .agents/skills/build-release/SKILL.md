# Build & Packaging Workflow (GameRoomLog)

This skill describes how to package GameRoomLog into standalone distributable packages (**Linux AppImage** and **Windows .EXE**).

---

## 1. Automated CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

The repository includes a complete GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/build-release.yml`).

### Triggering an Automated Cloud Build:
Whenever a version tag is pushed (e.g. `git push origin v0.3.0`), GitHub Actions will:
1. Run the entire automated test suite (`pytest -v`).
2. Build the **Linux AppImage** on Ubuntu 22.04 (`dist/GameRoomLog-x86_64.AppImage`).
3. Build the **Windows Executable** on Windows (`dist/GameRoomLog-Windows-x64.zip`).
4. Automatically create a **GitHub Release** and attach the binaries for download.

You can also trigger builds manually via GitHub Web UI under the **Actions** tab -> **Build & Release GameRoomLog** -> **Run workflow**.

## 2. Local Linux Build (AppImage)

To compile an AppImage locally on Linux:

```bash
# Execute o script de build
./scripts/build_appimage.sh
```

Output:
`dist/GameRoomLog-x86_64.AppImage`

---

## 3. Local Windows Build (.EXE)

To compile a `.exe` on Windows:

```cmd
scripts\build_windows.bat
```

Output:
`dist\GameRoomLog-Windows-x64.zip`
