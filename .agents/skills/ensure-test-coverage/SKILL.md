# Ensure Test Coverage Workflow (GameRoomLog)

This skill provides a systematic protocol to guarantee that any new feature, route, business logic, or frontend component is covered by automated tests before work is marked complete.

## Workflow Sequence

Whenever you implement a new feature or change existing behavior:

### Step 1: Identify Changed Components & Needs
Determine the scope of the new feature:
- **Backend Service (`backend/app/services/`)**: Needs unit tests in `backend/tests/test_services.py` validating inputs, edge cases, error conditions, and database persistence.
- **Backend Endpoint (`backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/`)**: Needs API integration tests in `backend/tests/test_api.py` validating HTTP status codes (e.g., `200`, `201`, `404`, `422`), request payload validation, and responses.
- **Frontend API Client (`frontend_desktop/api_client/client.py`)**: Needs tests in `frontend_desktop/tests/test_api_client.py` mocking the HTTP calls with `responses`.
- **Frontend UI / Components (`frontend_desktop/views/components/`)**: Needs tests in `frontend_desktop/tests/test_state_mutations.py` or `frontend_desktop/tests/test_performance.py` for DOM/widget updates and responsiveness.

---

### Step 2: Check Existing Coverage
Run the automated coverage check helper:

```bash
./venv/bin/python .agents/skills/ensure-test-coverage/scripts/check_coverage.py
```
Or directly via pytest:
```bash
./venv/bin/pytest --cov=backend/app --cov=frontend_desktop/api_client --cov-report=term-missing
```

Review the `Missing` column in the report to spot unexercised code paths.

---

### Step 3: Implement Missing Tests
If the new feature lacks test coverage, immediately write tests covering:
1. **Happy Path**: Standard successful execution with expected outputs.
2. **Edge Cases / Error Cases**: Invalid IDs, empty collections, malformed inputs, or missing fields.
3. **State Integrity**: Verifying that database models or UI widgets are updated cleanly in-place without side effects.

---

### Step 4: Verification & Gatekeeping
Re-run the entire test suite:

```bash
./venv/bin/pytest -v
```

Ensure:
- ✅ 100% of tests pass.
- ✅ Execution is fast (< 2 seconds total).
- ✅ Pre-commit hook (`.git/hooks/pre-commit`) will not be blocked.
